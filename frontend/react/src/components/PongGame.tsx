/**
 * Time-based Movement System with Normalized Velocities
 * 
 * This game uses a time-based movement system (delta time) rather than a frame-based system,
 * combined with normalized velocity values to ensure consistent game speed across all devices:
 * 
 * 1. All velocities are normalized (values between 0-1, typically around 0.3-0.8)
 * 2. A configurable ball speed (using a slider from 1-10) is applied to these normalized values
 * 3. Movement is scaled by deltaTime (time since last frame), ensuring consistent speed
 * 4. This approach guarantees uniform gameplay experience regardless of device performance
 * 
 * Benefits of this approach:
 * - Predictable ball behavior (always bounces at same angles and speeds)
 * - Smooth gameplay on both high-end and low-end devices
 * - Easier to balance difficulty since speeds are standardized
 * 
 * Key parameters:
 * - Ball Speed: Configurable from 1-10, translating to 80-400 units per second (exponential scaling)
 * - paddleSpeedPerSecond: 300 units the paddle moves per second
 * - normalizedVelocities: X=0.8, Y=0.4 (standard normalized speed components)
